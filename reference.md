# Psychometrics 

## The specificity of psychological measurement

We aim to measure (a participant's location on a) latent variable: $\zeta$

## The problem with latent variables?

We gain only indirect access to (a participants location on) $\zeta$

Import: Therefore we need a measurement instrument

e.g.: test or questionnaire

## What is a latent variable?

A not-directly observable variable

e.g.: cognitive abilities, personality traits, motivation, quality of life,
diseases in psychopathology.

## The 2 problems of psychological measurement 

1. Precision of a test: No test measures $\zeta$ perfectly; we have to deal
   with some degree of measurement error. 
2. Instability over time: If we were to perform repeated measurements on a
   single person over time (under the same external conditions), we cannot
   expect that the results will be identical.[^1]










[^1]: This repeated measurement concept (without necessarily being able to
  obtain multiple measurements per participant) plays an important role when
  assessing the quality or consistency of a test.
