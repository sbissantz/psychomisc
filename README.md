Welcome to my repository! I am happy to have you here. Once again, the repo's
plan is ambitious. In a nutshell: I wanted to improve my psychometric modeling
skills. But how to start? Well, I've found that I appreciate hands-on books. So
I guess I'll start with *Modern Psychometrics with R*[^1] by Patrick Mair. I
stumbled across this book a year ago. Now it's time to take it off the
bookshelf. Flipping through it, I quickly realized that it includes some great
chapters  I was missing in my master's program. For example, Bayesian factor
analysis or Bayesian 2-PL estimation.

I will first focus on understanding the models and fitting them. Then, after
working through the book, I will switch to a pure Bayesian approach. Recoding
Rov Levy's and Robert J. Mislevy's *Bayesian Psychometric Modeling*[^2] in Stan
will show me any gaps in my knowledge. Noah Padgett has already done this [^3].
His script will help me evaluate my code and stay on track. Neat!
